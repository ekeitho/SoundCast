Soundcloud doesn't have a Google Cast support and I hate casting my Android screen, because it kills my battery.
There are other apps that do something similar, but I wanted to make it very simple and get extra practice in developing chromecast apps.
So I created this extremely minimal Android App so I don't have to kill my battery anymore. :)

All you have to do is put a soundcloud link in the text box and click, 'cast'.

Supports:
	- Album Art
		- if no album art, will grab artist photo
	- Artist Name
	- Title of Song
	- Small cache for recentely casted soundcloud links

Note:
	- Not all songs have a streamable link url and some endpoints are blocked by Soundcloud

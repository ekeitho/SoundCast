Soundcloud doesn't have a Google Cast support and I hate casting my Android screen, because it kills my battery.
There are other apps that do something similar, but I wanted to make it very simple and get extra practice in developing chromecast apps.
So I created this extremely minimal Android App in a day so I don't have to kill my battery anymore. :)

All you have to do is put a soundcloud link in the text box and click, 'cast'.
